            <p>Before you start working out you have to decide what are your goals and are they long term or short term.
                Many people will go to the gym and continue with it into their retirement years yet some will go to the gym 
                for a short term goal like losing weight for a wedding or gaining muscle for a movie roll. 
                These all determine how you will eat and train when you go to the gym.</p>

            <h1>This picture showcases the 4 different ways to train while weightlifting in the gym:</h1>
            <div class="container">
                <div id="endurance" class="box">
                    <h2>Endurance</h2>
                    <p>You would lift for endurance if you wanted to get your heartrate up and burn as much fat/calories as possible, this method is used mainly by circuit classes and HITT workouts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <div id="power" class="box">
                    <h2>Power</h2>
                    <p>You would lift for power if you wanted explosive force and being able to put out your maximum strength in short quick bursts, which is mainly useful for sports like football and boxing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <div id="strength" class="box">
                    <h2>Strength</h2>
                    <p>You would lift for strength if you just wanted to go for pure strength and maximum muscle mass growth, power lifters mainly use this method as their competitions are purely about lifting the most amount of weight you possibly can.</p> 
            </div>     
            <div class="container">
                <div id="hypertrophy" class="box">
                    <h2>Hypertrophy</h2>   
                    <p>You would lift for Hypertrophy if you wanted to increase the size of your muscles and make them look bigger, but without actually adding as much muscle mass as it looks. Hypertrophy could be compared to a balloon being blown up as in your muscles will increase in size and strength but mainly will benefit from just looking fuller than they are, this method is mainly used by bodybuilders and models.</p>
